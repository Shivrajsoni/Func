ABOUT THE CENTRE
Department cum National Centre for Human Genome Studies and Research is relatively new education centre established in
year 2002. The first sequencing of the human genome in 2002 provided a glimpse of humans at our most basic molecular level. The main goal of our department is to inspire and educate young minds in Genetics and Genomics. Students learn to approach
problems and formulate questions that span the full range of biological systems
Research in Genetics and Genomics is quickly becoming the key source of new insights
treatments of both rare monogenic diseases and common complex diseases such as coronary heart disease
ethos reflects and fosters a passion for discovery and curiosity and a commitment to excellence. The goal of this Centre is to
provide the most advanced and comprehensive education possible related to human genome at the post graduate level. We
highly value interdisciplinary knowledge and collaboration as the core of our effort. Our research addresses the molecular
computational and biophysical approaches to study various questions/problems in biology. We are motivated towards
understanding of human biology and disease and to develop solutions to societal health problems. Mission is to establish
specific scientific programs that will be available to the public
